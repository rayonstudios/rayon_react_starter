## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rayonstudios/rayon_react_starter
    cd rayon-react-starter
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

The application should now be running on http://localhost:5173

## Folde Structure

```bash
├── lib/         # Reusable, feature-independent code
├── modules/     # Feature-dependent code
├── pages/       # Page components
└── ...
```

- Use **snake_case** for file and folder names to maintain consistency.
- Feature-based folder structure ensures a clean separation of concerns for better scalability and maintainability.

## Best Practices

- Reusable code should generally reside in the `lib` folder.
- Feature-dependent code should be organized under `modules`.
Pages components should be placed under the `pages` folder.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Detailed Developer Documentation
- [ ] Add unit, integration and e2e tests support
- [ ] Convert to a modular CLI based tools
